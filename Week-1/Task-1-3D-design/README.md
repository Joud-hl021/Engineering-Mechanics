3D Vase Design - Onshape

üìå Project Overview

This is a 3D vase design created using Onshape, a cloud-based CAD platform. The vase is designed to be both functional and aesthetic, suitable for decorative purposes or as a practical item in various settings. The design focuses on smooth curves, hollow structure, and a polished finish, making it a perfect example of modern CAD design techniques.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

Several key tools and CAD techniques were used to create this design:
 ‚Ä¢ Loft: Used to generate the smooth transition from the bottom of the vase to the top, ensuring a seamless, elegant shape.
 ‚Ä¢ Shell: Applied to hollow out the interior of the vase, making it lightweight while keeping the exterior strong.
 ‚Ä¢ Fillet: Added to the edges to smooth sharp corners and enhance the visual flow of the design.

üåü How It Can Be Used
 ‚Ä¢ Decorative Piece: The vase can be used as a stylish decoration for homes, offices, or any living space.
 ‚Ä¢ Functional Use: While primarily decorative, the vase can also hold artificial flowers or be used as a small storage container.
 ‚Ä¢ 3D Printing: This design can easily be 3D printed, allowing for custom production in various sizes and materials like PLA, ABS, or resin.
 ‚Ä¢ Customization: Users can modify the design to adjust the size, shape, or add personalized features like patterns or textures.

üí° Benefits of the Design
 ‚Ä¢ Lightweight due to the hollow structure created with the Shell tool, making it easy to handle and transport.
 ‚Ä¢ Visually appealing with smooth transitions and rounded edges that create a modern and clean aesthetic.
 ‚Ä¢ Customizable: The design can be adjusted and customized according to user preferences for different uses or visual styles.
