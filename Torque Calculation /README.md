# Torque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection for a Robotic Arm

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to:
- **Calculate the required torque** for each joint of a robotic arm consisting of three segments.
- detailed as requested:

# Torque Calfor each joint so they can safely handle the payload (1 kg) with an adequate safety margin.

## 2. Basic Data
-vo Motor Selec1 kg  
- Gravitational Acceleration: 9.81 m/s²  
- Segment Lengths:  
  - First segment (from the base to Joint 2): 15 cm (0.15 m)  
  - Second segment (from Joint 2 to Joint 3): 10 cm (0.10 m)  
  - Third segment (from Joint 3 to the end of the arm): 4 cm (0.04 m)

## 3. Torque Calculation Equation
We use the equation:
\[
\tau = F \times d
\]
where:
- \(\tau\) = Torque (Newton·meter)
- \(F\) = Force (Newtons)
- \(d\) = Distance from the rotation axis to the point of force application (meters)

>a robotic aThis calculation assumes the arm itself is negligible compared to the payload.

---

## 4. Calculating the Force from the Payload
We know that:
\[
F = m \times g
\]
where:
- \( m = 1 \) kg  
- \( g = 9.81 \) m/s²  

Thus:
\[
F = 1 \times 9.81 = 9.81\,\text{Newtons}
\]

## 5. Calculating Torque at Each Joint

### 5.1 Joint 1 (Base)
- joint so they can safely handle the payloa 
  \( d_1 = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.29 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 1:  
  \[
  \tau_1 = 9.81 \times 0.29 \approx 2.84\,\text{N·m}
  \]

### 5.2 Joint 2 (Elbow)
-orque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection 
  \( d_2 = 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.14 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 2:  
  \[
  \tau_2 = 9.81 \times 0.14 \approx 1.37\,\text{N·m}
  \]

### 5.3 Joint 3 (Wrist)
-orque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection 
  \( d_3 = 0.04 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 3:  
  \[
  \tau_3 = 9.81 \times 0.04 \approx 0.39\,\text{N·m}
  \]

## 6. Selecting the Servo Motors
It is advisable to choose servo motors with a torque capacity about 20–30% higher than the calculated values to provide a safety margin. Below are some example recommendations:
