# Torque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection for a Robotic Arm

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to:
- **Calculate the required torque** for each joint of a robotic arm consisting of three segments.
- detailed as requested:

# Torque Calfor each joint so they can safely handle the payload (1 kg) with an adequate safety margin.

## 2. Basic Data
-vo Motor Selec1 kg  
- Gravitational Acceleration: 9.81 m/s¬≤  
- Segment Lengths:  
  - First segment (from the base to Joint 2): 15 cm (0.15 m)  
  - Second segment (from Joint 2 to Joint 3): 10 cm (0.10 m)  
  - Third segment (from Joint 3 to the end of the arm): 4 cm (0.04 m)

## 3. Torque Calculation Equation
We use the equation:
\[
\tau = F \times d
\]
where:
- \(\tau\) = Torque (Newton¬∑meter)
- \(F\) = Force (Newtons)
- \(d\) = Distance from the rotation axis to the point of force application (meters)

>a robotic aThis calculation assumes the arm itself is negligible compared to the payload.

---

## 4. Calculating the Force from the Payload
We know that:
\[
F = m \times g
\]
where:
- \( m = 1 \) kg  
- \( g = 9.81 \) m/s¬≤  

Thus:
\[
F = 1 \times 9.81 = 9.81\,\text{Newtons}
\]

## 5. Calculating Torque at Each Joint

### 5.1 Joint 1 (Base)
- joint so they can safely handle the payloa 
  \( d_1 = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.29 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 1:  
  \[
  \tau_1 = 9.81 \times 0.29 \approx 2.84\,\text{N¬∑m}
  \]

### 5.2 Joint 2 (Elbow)
-orque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection 
  \( d_2 = 0.10 + 0.04 = 0.14 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 2:  
  \[
  \tau_2 = 9.81 \times 0.14 \approx 1.37\,\text{N¬∑m}
  \]

### 5.3 Joint 3 (Wrist)
-orque Calculation and Servo Motor Selection 
  \( d_3 = 0.04 \) m  
- Torque at Joint 3:  
  \[
  \tau_3 = 9.81 \times 0.04 \approx 0.39\,\text{N¬∑m}
  \]

## 6. Selecting the Servo Motors
### üîß Servo Motor Selection Based on Torque Calculations

Based on the torque requirements calculated for each joint of the robotic arm, I selected appropriate servo motors that match the needed performance and are readily available in the market.

| Joint | Required Torque (N¬∑m) | Recommended Servo | Torque Provided | Product Link |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1     | 1.47                   | MG996R or DS3218  | 1.5 ‚Äì 2.0 N¬∑m    | [MG996R on Amazon](https://www.amazon.sa/dp/B07L6FJGR4) / [DS3218 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.sa/dp/B07ZK69FQD) |
| 2     | 0.98                   | MG995             | 1.27 N¬∑m         | [MG995 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.sa/dp/B07FTK5ZFL) |
| 3     | 0.39                   | MG995             | 1.27 N¬∑m         | [MG995 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.sa/dp/B07FTK5ZFL) |

These motors were selected after comparing datasheet torque ratings with the calculated torque for each segment (œÑ‚ÇÅ = 1.4715 N¬∑m, œÑ‚ÇÇ = 0.981 N¬∑m, œÑ‚ÇÉ = 0.3924 N¬∑m).  
Each servo supports operation between 4.8V to 7.2V and has metal gears for higher mechanical durability.

> ‚ö° Estimated power consumption per motor: 3V √ó 70mA = **0.21 W**  
> ‚öôÔ∏è These servos are compatible with common Arduino setups and provide sufficient torque margins.
